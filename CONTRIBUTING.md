# Contributing

</div>

Contributions to KaylibKit are more than welcome! I would highly suggest opening up an issue first to discuss the upcoming change.

## Small guideline

- Follow the same code structure.
- Comment your code.
- Ensure that your code is in the correct package.

## How to

1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
